Welcome to my Meteorology repo! This repository will contain weather-related Python projects.

So far, I have worked on a single fun project for computing thunderstorm & severe thunderstorm risk levels based on different meteorological elements. My drive for creating this stems from my passion for 
studying and predicting weather forecasts; my secondary hobby. For this project, I leveraged Python's "Tkinter" GUI library to produce the final product.

There are currently two files related to this project in the repo: 
    ThunderstormCalculator.py - contains the code written to produce the GUI 
    ThunderstormCalculator.exe - represents a standalone executable app file
